### General Info :

``` 
Lending loans to high-risk applicants is a major cause of financial losses, commonly 
referred to as credit loss. Credit loss occurs when a borrower either refuses to 
repay or defaults on the loan, resulting in the lender losing the funds owed.

The primary goal of this analysis is to identify these high-risk loan applicants, 
enabling the company to minimize the number of such loans and, in turn, reduce the 
total credit loss. This case study focuses on using exploratory data analysis (EDA) 
to pinpoint the factors that contribute to loan default.

The analysis aims to uncover the key variables that significantly predict loan default.
By understanding these factors, the company can improve its risk management and make
more informed decisions regarding its loan portfolio

### Conclusions :

``` 
Key Insights on "Charged-Off" Loans with Higher Default Risk
1.Applicant Type: Renters have a higher likelihood of defaulting.
2.Loan Purpose: Loans taken for debt consolidation show a greater risk of default.
3.Verification Status: Applications marked as "Not Verified" are more likely to default.
4.Loan Term: Terms exceeding 36 months are associated with higher default rates.
5.Funding Range: Funded amounts between $5,000 and $10,000 are at higher risk.
6.Loan Amount: Loans within the $5,000 to $10,000 range have higher chances of default.
7.Installment Range: Monthly installments between $145 and $274 show increased default risk.
8.Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio: Ratios between 12% and 18% are linked to higher defaults.
Additional Observations
1.Seasonal Trends: December shows a spike in defaults for disbursed loans.
2.Economic Impact: Financial crises, such as in 2011, correlate with increased charged-off loans.


Based on Bi-Variate Analysis of "Charged-Off" Loans, the Following Applicant Categories Show the Highest Default Risk:
Applicants taking loans for home improvement with an income between $60k - $70k
Applicants with MORTGAGE home ownership and an income between $60k - $70k
Applicants with loan amounts in the range of $30k - $35k who are charged an interest rate of 15% - 17.5%
